    # You have to use the goto_index_ll function, to get the current node, after which the new Node should be inserted.

    # it is easier to have two separate functions.

# The Time for every insertion is measured and printed, together with the information on list size and position of insertion.
# In the End all the results are printed together for each position of insertion.
# I will explain the calculation of the time for insertion after index 0. The calculation for the other positions is the same, just with a different index.
# When running the code it will be shown that no matter where the item is inserted or how large the list is,
# the time it takes to insert the element is always constant (On my Computer always Zero, but it may differ depending on hardware.)
